The key porpouse of the SDK is to ease development of blockchain applications. For this reason it is key to have a visual studio extension that can autofill and describe the diffrent tokens, functions and structures that the SDK can do. If an extension is not possible then the SDK library must be written in a way that takes advantage of VS Code's descriptive features.
